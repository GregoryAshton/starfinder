# Installation

To install `starfinder` directly, you will need to have a terminal with `git` and a working `python` environment. With these in hand follow the instructions below (note the command pre-pended with a `#` are comments while those pre-pended by `$` are to be run in the terminal):
```
# Clone the github repository
$ git clone https://github.com/GregoryAshton/starfinder.git

# Enter the directory
$ cd starfinder

# Install the requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install starfinder, the -e installs it in "editable" mode
$ pip install -e .
```

To install `starfinder` from `pip`, simply run
```
$ pip install starfinder
```
